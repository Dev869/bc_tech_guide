<p>There are two Apple TVs of the four Zwift Stations. One Apple TV is on the far left station and the other is on the far right station. The two stations in the middle are going to be regular computers.</p>
<h4 id="the-remotes">The Remotes</h4>
<p>Each Apple TV has its own Apple TV remote which look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/bc_tech_guide/images/apple-tv-remote.jpeg" style="height:150px;" /></p>

<p>Each remote also has its own number that coordinates to the numbers placed on the bottom left of each TV.</p>

<h4 id="turning-on-the-apple-tv">Turning on the Apple TV</h4>
<p>Since the Apple TVs will sometimes go into a <em>sleep mode</em>, you will likely need to click around on the remote to wake up the TV. Provided the Samsung TV itself is already on (there is no white light on at the bottom of the display), you should see something turn on.</p>

<h2 id="ant--bluetooth">ANT+ &amp; Bluetooth</h2>
<h3 id="ant">ANT+</h3>
<p>ANT+ works similarly to Bluetooth as a way to connect sensors except that it requires a dongle to operate. Because of this, ANT+ only works on the middle two stations as the Apple TVs do not have any port for the dongle.</p>

<p>ANT+ should not be necessary for most of the newest sensors, but if you have an older sensor you are trying to connect it may only be ANT+ compatible. The sensor should also say somewhere on it if it it bluetooth and ANT+ compatible or only ANT+ compatible.</p>
<h3 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h3>
<p>Bluetooth should work automatically on every station, so if you are having issues connecting sensors your issue most likely has nothing to do with the bluetooth.</p>

<h3 id="computers-middle-stations">Computers (Middle Stations)</h3>
<p>Each Zwift station already has Zwift pre-installed and the application should be easily accessible from the desktop. If Zwift <em>is not</em> already clearly on the desktop, then it should be accessible through</p>
