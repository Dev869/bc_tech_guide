<p>The Zoom station at the mats is a lot more simple than the one set up in the Window Room. While it does not have the more <em>fancy</em> mic and camera setup, you <strong>will need to turn on the TV in order to get it running</strong>. There should be remote sitting on one of the shelves.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If only the camera on the computer is working,</strong> this is likely an issue with the <strong>Mevo</strong> (the camera sitting above the TV).
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fix 1:</strong> Make sure the camera turned on. If there is no glowing light on the front of the Mevo, it’s off. To turn it on, press and hold the button on the back of the camera.</li>
      <li><strong>Fix 2:</strong> Make sure the USB cable is properly inserted into the ports sitting snug in the camera and the computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Fix 3:</strong> <em>This one is a bit more complex.</em> The issue could require a firmware update. To update the camera, open the <strong>Mevo</strong> app on the <strong>Business phone.</strong> It should automatically recognize the camera as the “Mat Mevo”. Then, it should prompt you for a firmware update. Agree to whatever terms and install it. This may take a few minutes.</li>
