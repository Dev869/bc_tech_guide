<h2 id="chrome-remote-desktop">Chrome Remote Desktop</h2>
<p>Chrome Remote Desktop is a great tool if you are in charge of IT, especially if you are not physically at BC Fitness. Itâ€™s also fairly simple and easy to use, and if itâ€™s not already setup on one of the computers, itâ€™s very easy to get working.</p>
<h3 id="usage--logins">Usage &amp; Logins</h3>
<p>Using the BC Fitness chrome account, login to chrome Remote Desktop <a href="https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/">here</a>. Once youâ€™re all logged in, you will also need the password to the machine to get in. For security reasons, however, this password will be provided on paper along with everything else in the security &amp; logins handbook.</p>

<p>Once you are connected to the computer, the process is fairly straightforward.</p>

<h2 id="bc-server">BC Server</h2>
<p>Go <a href="https://bcfitnesscafe.synology.me:42069/">here</a> to access the server from anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The BC Server is a rack Synology server with upwards of 48TB of storage. As such, the server has quite a bit of storage allocated to security footage, but also some storage allocated to usage by the BC Fitness + Cafe Staff.</p>
<h3 id="logins">Logins</h3>
<p>Since not very many people use the Synology server, logins have not yet been distributed. However, they will be put into the security &amp; logins handbook once that has been created.</p>
<h3 id="rules--usage">Rules &amp; Usage</h3>
<p>Each user will be provided a certain amount of storage which will be determined at a later date. In terms of rules, just be responsible and donâ€™t use the server as a replacement for Google Drive or some sort of storage for all of your GoPro video. The server is really meant for sharing data between co-workers, which includes anything related to BC Fitness + Cafe <em>and/or</em> GS Andiamo / Team California.</p>
<h2 id="security-cameras">Security Cameras</h2>
<p>There are 8 security cameras inside BC Fitness + Cafe and 1 security camera facing the parking lot. For security reasons, this info will be kept in the security &amp; logins handbook. In addition, the location of the Reolink NVR (where the cameras are powered, wired, and recorded from) will also be kept in the security &amp; logins handbook.</p>
<h3 id="login--wiring">Login &amp; Wiring</h3>
<p>Like everything else, the login information for the security cameras will be provided in the security &amp; logins handbook.</p>
<h3 id="ftp-setup">FTP Setup</h3>
<p>Since the security cameras require their proprietary NVR in order to record all the security footage, the Reolink NVR uses FTP to transfer files from its local hard drives to the security footage partition in the BC Synology Server.</p>

<p>There is nothing you should need to do with the FTP connection unless it stops uploading from the Reolink NVR to the BC Server.</p>

<h2 id="router-modem-and-orbi-mesh">Router, Modem and Orbi Mesh</h2>
<p>We have one modem, two routers, and two satellites that connect to the orbit routers.</p>
<h3 id="spectrum-account">Spectrum Account</h3>
<p><em>Login provided on the BC Security Card</em></p>
<h2 id="ethernet-cabling">Ethernet Cabling</h2>
<p>Donâ€™t worry about the ethernet cabling unless you really feel like ripping everything apart and spending countless hours on something that will result in only pain and suffering.</p>
<h3 id="ethernet-switches">Ethernet Switches</h3>
<p>At the moment, there are two ethernet switches that are used to route ethernet to many places at once. One of the switches is located in the store room and the other is located directly under the BC Server.</p>
