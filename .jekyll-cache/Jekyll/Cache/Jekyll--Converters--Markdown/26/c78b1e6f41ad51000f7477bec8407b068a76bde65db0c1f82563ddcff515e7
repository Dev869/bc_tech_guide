<h2 id="printer">Printer</h2>
<p>To use the printer, go through whatever printing prompt and make sure you select the <strong>HP Color LaserJet MFP M477fdn</strong> printer for the printing destination.</p>
<h2 id="wifi">Wifi</h2>
<p>There are two Wifi networks:</p>
<ol>
  <li>BikecoachSecure
    <ul>
      <li>Password in BC Security  Card</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>BCFitnessCafe
    <ul>
      <li>Password: bcfitnesscafe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>BikecoachSecure is meant for <em>staff only</em> and it is also the faster network. BCFitnessCafe, on the other hand, is a slower network that is meant for guests, customers, or clients.</p>
