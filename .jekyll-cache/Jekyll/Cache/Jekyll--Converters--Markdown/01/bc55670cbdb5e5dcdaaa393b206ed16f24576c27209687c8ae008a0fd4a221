<h2 id="feel-free-to-explore">Feel Free to Explore</h2>
<p>This website has one purpose: to serve as a replacement for my job. I won’t be available forever and seeing as there’s a bit too much to compile into one paragraph or even several pages, this is the best alternative.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-documentation-is-to-be-used">How the documentation is to be used</h2>
<p>Since reading through documentation can be tedious and time-consuming, I will make scannable QR codes placed in front of each “tech area”. If something goes wrong or someone simply wants to learn how to use something, that’s what it’s there for.</p>
