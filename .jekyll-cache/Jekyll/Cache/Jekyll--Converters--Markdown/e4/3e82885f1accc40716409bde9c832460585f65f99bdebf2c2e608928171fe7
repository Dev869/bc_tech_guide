<h2 id="bc-chrome-account">BC Chrome Account</h2>
<p>bcfitnesscafe@gmail.com</p>

<p>For everyoneâ€™s convenience, I have created a Google Chrome Account for BC Fitness + Cafe. This allows for a seamless syncing of bookmarks, logins, and Google Drive data across all the computers in BC. The login for the google chrome account is along with all the other accounts in the BC Security Card.</p>

<p><strong>The Google Chrome account is accessible by opening up on the Chrome browser and logging into the account if you are not already logged in. The login for this account is also provided to you the security card.</strong></p>
<h3 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h3>
<p>There are several bookmarks located under the search bar in Google Chrome. Feel free to check them out! For every bookmark that requires you to login to some account, it should autofill the login for you so you donâ€™t need to pull out the security card.</p>
<h3 id="saved-passwords">Saved Passwords</h3>
<p>Google Chrome has this very cool feature where it saves logins for all the accounts you will need access to. These passwords only accessible to you when you are logged in to the Chrome account, so thereâ€™s not too much of a security threat there. You can access these logins by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the three vertical dots on the top right of the Google Chrome window</li>
  <li>Select <strong>settings</strong></li>
  <li>Scroll down to the section where it says <strong>Autofill</strong> (this should be right at the top)</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Passwords</strong></li>
  <li>Search for your desired password</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: You may be required to enter the password for the computer you are using in order to view or copy your desired password. This password will be provided to you in the security card.</p>
<h3 id="google-photos">Google Photos</h3>
<p>There is a Google Photos account also associated with the BC Fitness + Cafe email that has photos for anything associated with BC Fitness + Cafe. To access Google Photos, go <a href="https://photos.google.com/login">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="google-drive">Google Drive</h3>
<p>As there is a Google account for BC Fitness + Cafe, there is also a Google Drive that can be used to universally share important files with anyone else who has access to the same shared folder or the BC google account itself. To access the Google Drive, go <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bc-email">BC Email</h2>
<p>The BC Email is the same login as the Google Chrome Account (as they are the same thing). This will also be provided in the security card.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the BC email is to create accounts for services and software such as Asset Tiger, Canva, etc. so there is no need to use the BC Email for anything other than creating online accounts for third-party software.</p>
<h2 id="bc-apple-id">BC Apple ID</h2>
<p>Much like the BC Email, there is a also a BC Apple ID that is associated with all the apple products at BC Fitness + Cafe. This allows us to seamlessly sync purchased applications across all Apple the devices within the business.</p>

<p>The login for the BC Apple ID is also provided in the security card.</p>
