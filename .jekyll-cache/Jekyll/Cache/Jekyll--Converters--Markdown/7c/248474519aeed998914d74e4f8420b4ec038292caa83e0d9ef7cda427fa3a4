I"–<h1 id="point-of-sale">Point of Sale</h1>
<p>There are two POS stations each compatible with both Square and Mindbody:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Coffee Bar</li>
  <li>In the Mechanics Area</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="square">Square</h2>
<p>Thereâ€™s a lot going on here, and since I donâ€™t want to be writing an entire manuscript trying to explain it to you, I will direct you <a href="https://squareup.com/help/us/en">here</a> if you are having any issues.</p>

<p>For basic usage of the POS system, itâ€™s fairly self-explanatory.</p>
<h2 id="mindbody">Mindbody</h2>
<p><em>Each staff member should have their own account, but if you use the BC Fitness chrome account you should be able to just log in.</em></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s even more going on here than Square, so I will also direct you <a href="https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/?language=en_US">here</a>.</p>

<p>Have fun with Mindbody, itâ€™ll be a nice challenge.</p>
