It's small and black and sits atop of the Denon AVR. *You will likely never need to do anything with the actual Apple TV unit.* #### Playing something on the TV 1. Click any button multiple times on the **Apple TV Remote** as shown above to wake up the Apple TV. 2. Press the **Menu** button on the remote to get to the main Home Screen. 3. Use the black surface on the top section of the remote as a **trackpad** to select what you want to play. **We normally play cycling videos, so here's a few of the apps to use for that:** - NBC Sports - Youtube ### Airplay **Airplay** is a great way to wirelessly mirror or extend the display from the computer (an iMac) to the Apple TV. This allows you to play any YouTube videos from the computer or simply display a menu. #### [How to do Airplay](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/stream-content-to-apple-tv-mh40624/mac){: .btn} ### TV Audio As we are normally playing audio from the Sonos (more about that later) to the *Spin Bikes* or the *Coffee Bar* speakers in the ceiling or mounted to the obelisks, **you will almost never need to play audio from the TV unless you aren't playing music and you want to hear what's coming from what you are playing on the TV.** ## Audio & Music ",

    "content": "# IT Maintenance ## Chrome Remote Desktop Chrome Remote Desktop is a great tool if you are in charge of IT, especially if you are not physically at BC Fitness. It's also fairly simple and easy to use, and if it's not already setup on one of the computers, it's very easy to get working. ### Usage & Logins Using the BC Fitness chrome account, login to chrome Remote Desktop [here](https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/). Once you're all logged in, you will also need the password to the machine to get in. For security reasons, however, this password will be provided on paper along with everything else in the security & logins handbook. Once you are connected to the computer, the process is fairly straightforward. ## BC Server Go [here](https://bcfitnesscafe.synology.me:42069/) to access the server from anywhere in the world. The BC Server is a rack Synology server with upwards of 48TB of storage. As such, the server has quite a bit of storage allocated to security footage, but also some storage allocated to usage by the BC Fitness + Cafe Staff. ### Logins Since not very many people use the Synology server, logins have not yet been distributed. However, they will be put into the security & logins handbook once that has been created. ### Rules & Usage Each user will be provided a certain amount of storage which will be determined at a later date. In terms of rules, just be responsible and don't use the server as a replacement for Google Drive or some sort of storage for all of your GoPro video. The server is really meant for sharing data between co-workers, which includes anything related to BC Fitness + Cafe *and/or* GS Andiamo / Team California. ## Security Cameras There are 8 security cameras inside BC Fitness + Cafe and 1 security camera facing the parking lot. For security reasons, this info will be kept in the security & logins handbook. In addition, the location of the Reolink NVR (where the cameras are powered, wired, and recorded from) will also be kept in the security & logins handbook. ### Login & Wiring Like everything else, the login information for the security cameras will be provided in the security & logins handbook. ### FTP Setup Since the security cameras require their proprietary NVR in order to record all the security footage, the Reolink NVR uses FTP to transfer files from its local hard drives to the security footage partition in the BC Synology Server. There is nothing you should need to do with the FTP connection unless it stops uploading from the Reolink NVR to the BC Server. ",

You also have the option of posting to Facebook along with Instagram when you're going through to post. If you have any trouble posting, I would send off your post content to someone else who is available to make the post. ## Resources *If you're having trouble content to post, look here first* ### Google Photos There are several Google Photos albums that you can also contribute to) that have a bunch of photos you can use to post with.

    "content": "# Web Resources ## BC Chrome Account bcfitnesscafe@gmail.com For everyone's convenience, I have created a Google Chrome Account for BC Fitness + Cafe. This allows for a seamless syncing of bookmarks, logins, and Google Drive data across all the computers in BC. The login for the google chrome account is along with all the other accounts in the security & logins handbook. **The Google Chrome account is accessible by opening up on the Chrome browser and logging into the account if you are not already logged in. The login for this account is also provided to you the security & logins handbook.** ### Bookmarks There are several bookmarks located under the search bar in Google Chrome. Feel free to check them out! For every bookmark that requires you to login to some account, it should autofill the login for you so you don't need to pull out the security & logins handbook. ### Saved Passwords Google Chrome has this very cool feature where it saves logins for all the accounts you will need access to. These passwords only accessible to you when you are logged in to the Chrome account, so there's not too much of a security threat there. You can access these logins by following these steps: 1. Click on the three vertical dots on the top right of the Google Chrome window 2. Select **settings** 3. Scroll down to the section where it says **Autofill** (this should be right at the top) 4. Select **Passwords** 5. Search for your desired password Note: You may be required to enter the password for the computer you are using in order to view or copy your desired password. This password will be provided to you in the security & logins handbook. ### Google Photos There is a Google Photos account also associated with the BC Fitness + Cafe email that has photos for anything associated with BC Fitness + Cafe. To access Google Photos, go [here](https://photos.google.com/login). ### Google Drive As there is a Google account for BC Fitness + Cafe, there is also a Google Drive that can be used to universally share important files with anyone else who has access to the same shared folder or the BC google account itself. To access the Google Drive, go [here](https://www.google.com/drive/). ## BC Email The BC Email is the same login as the Google Chrome Account (as they are the same thing). This will also be provided in the security & logins handbook. The main purpose of the BC email is to create accounts for services and software such as Asset Tiger, Canva, etc. so there is no need to use the BC Email for anything other than creating online accounts for third-party software. ## BC Apple ID Much like the BC Email, there is a also a BC Apple ID that is associated with all the apple products at BC Fitness + Cafe. This allows us to seamlessly sync purchased applications across all Apple the devices within the business. The login for the BC Apple ID is also provided in the security & logins handbook. ",

    "content": "# Zwift Stations ## Computers, Apple TVs & Logins ### Apple TVs There are two Apple TVs of the four Zwift Stations. One Apple TV is on the far left station and the other is on the far right station. The two stations in the middle are going to be regular computers. #### The Remotes Each Apple TV has its own Apple TV remote which look like this: Each remote also has its own number that coordinates to the numbers placed on the bottom left of each TV. #### Turning on the Apple TV Since the Apple TVs will sometimes go into a *sleep mode*, you will likely need to click around on the remote to wake up the TV. Provided the TV itself is already on (there is no white light on at the bottom of the display), you should see something happen on the screen. If the TV is on and the remote isn't doing anything to wakeup the Apple TV, there are a few things that could be happening: 1. The remote is discharged - Plug it in 2. The TV is on the wrong input - Use the controls on the back the TV to change the input 3. The Apple TV is unplugged or the power strip is not turned on - Check the power strip and the connection for the Apple TV inside the Obelisk. ## ANT+ & Bluetooth ### ANT+ ANT+ works similarly to Bluetooth as a way to connect sensors except that it requires a dongle to operate. Because of this, ANT+ only works on the middle two stations as the Apple TVs do not have any port for the dongle. ANT+ should not be necessary for most of the newest sensors, but if you have an older sensor you are trying to connect it may only be ANT+ compatible. The sensor should also say somewhere on it if it it bluetooth and ANT+ compatible or only ANT+ compatible. ### Bluetooth Bluetooth should work automatically on every station, so if you are having issues connecting sensors your issue most likely has nothing to do with the bluetooth. ## Zwift Setup & Login ### Computers (Middle Stations) Each Zwift station already has Zwift pre-installed and the application should be easily accessible from the desktop. If Zwift *is not* already clearly on the desktop, then it should be accessible through the search bar or the applications menu. If you are unable to find the applications menu, please try harder. ## KIKR Snap *The most regular-looking KIKR trainers.* ### Snap Connection The same as any other sensor, except when connecting to Zwift select the \"controllable\" option. Since there are multiple KIKR trainers, make sure to select the trainer with the same ID that is taped atop of it as it is shown in Zwift. If none of the trainer IDs are the same as the one on your trainer, spin up only the trainer that you are using and you will be able to recognize it immediately as the one that is showing some sort of speed or power. ## KIKR Bike *The spaceship-looking fancy spin bike.* ### Bike Connection The same as any other sensor except when connecting to Zwift select the \"controllable\" option and make sure that you are connecting to the \"KIKR Bike\". This will automatically connect you to the bike and you should be all good to go. ## Other Sensors *Power meters, speed sensors, cadence, etc.* ### Power Meters Power meters connect the same way as any other sensor, except you select the **power** option as opposed to the **controllable** option. Note: *If you have a speed sensor, there is no need to have a power meter. If you do have a power meter, however, you will get far more accurate data transmitting to Zwift.* ### Cadence Meters Cadence meters will connect automatically if they are built in with your power meter, or you can simply select **cadence** in the Zwift connection menu (the same as any other sensor). ### Heartrate Monitors HR monitors connect the same as any other sensor, though you may need to get your heart rate up in order to determine which sensor on the list is yours. If there are no other heart rate sensors nearby, you should *only* see your heart rate sensor. ### Speed Sensors Speed sensors connect the same as any other sensor except you need to connect it as **speed**. Note: *If you already have a power meter connected, there is no need to use a speed sensor.* ### Steering Modules As of now the only steering module at BC Fitness + Cafe is integrated within the Wahoo KIKR Bike, which will connect to Zwift automatically upon connecting the bike itself. Note: The steering modules will do something during the special Zwift steering sections. More on that [here](https://support.wahoofitness.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019349600-KICKR-BIKE-and-Zwift-Steering-Everything-You-Need-to-Know). ",
