## Ring Doorbell
### Location
The ring doorbell is located to the left side of the the glass double doors at the main entrance of BC Fitness + Cafe.

There is also a ring doorbell *chime* module which is located inside of BC Fitness + Cafe. It makes a sound whenever someone walks by, so it's not too hard to find.
### Login
Only people who *need* access to the Ring Doorbell should be logged into the app. For security reasons, the login for the account is also in the security card.
