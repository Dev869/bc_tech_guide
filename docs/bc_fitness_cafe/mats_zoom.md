# Zoom Station (Front)
The Zoom station at the mats is a lot more simple than the one set up in the Window Room. While it does not have the more *fancy* mic and camera setup, you **will need to turn on the TV in order to get it running**. There should be remote sitting on one of the shelves.

## Setup Steps
1. Login to the computer *the login should be on a little card taped to the system.*
2. Open up Zoom and login. *The Zoom logins are in the BC Fitness secure Google Doc.*
3. You're all set for your class!
