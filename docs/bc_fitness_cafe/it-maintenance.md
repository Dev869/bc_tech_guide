# IT Maintenance
## Chrome Remote Desktop
Chrome Remote Desktop is a great tool if you are in charge of IT, especially if you are not physically at BC Fitness. It's also fairly simple and easy to use, and if it's not already setup on one of the computers, it's very easy to get working.
### Usage & Logins
Using the BC Fitness chrome account, login to chrome Remote Desktop [here](https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/). Once you're all logged in, you will also need the password to the machine to get in. For security reasons, however, this password will be provided on paper along with everything else in the logins & accounts handbook.

Once you are connected to the computer, the process is fairly straightforward.
