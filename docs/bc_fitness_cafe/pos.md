# Point of Sale
There are two POS stations each compatible with both Square and Mindbody:
1. In the Coffee Bar
2. In the Mechanics Area

## Square
There's a lot going on here, and since I don't want to be writing an entire manuscript trying to explain it to you, I will direct you [here](https://squareup.com/help/us/en) if you are having any issues.

For basic usage of the POS system, it's fairly self-explanatory.
## Mindbody
*Each staff member should have their own account, but if you use the BC Fitness chrome account you should be able to just log in.*

There's even more going on here than Square, so I will also direct you [here](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/?language=en_US).

Have fun with Mindbody, it'll be a nice challenge.
