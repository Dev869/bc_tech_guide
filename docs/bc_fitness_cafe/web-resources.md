## BC Chrome Account
For everyone's convenience, I have created a Google Chrome Account for BC Fitness + Cafe. This allows for a seamless syncing of bookmarks, logins, and Google Drive data across all the computers in BC.

**The Google Chrome account is accessible by opening up on the Chrome browser and logging into the account if you are not already logged in. The login for this account is also provided to you the security & logins handbook.**
### Bookmarks
There are several bookmarks located under the search bar in Google Chrome. Feel free to check them out! For every bookmark that requires you to login to some account, it should autofill the login for you so you don't need to pull out the security & logins handbook.
### Saved Passwords
Google Chrome has this very cool feature where it saves logins for all the accounts you will need access to. These passwords only accessible to you when you are logged in to the Chrome account, so there's not too much of a security threat there. You can access these logins by following these steps:
1. Click on the three vertical dots on the top right of the Google Chrome window
2. Select **settings**
3. Scroll down to the section where it says **Autofill** (this should be right at the top)
4. Select **Passwords**
5. Search for your desired password
- Note: You may be required to enter the password for the computer you are using in order to view or copy your desired password. This password will be provided to you in the security & logins handbook.
