# Printer & Wifi
## Printer
To use the printer, go through whatever printing prompt and make sure you select the **HP Color LaserJet MFP M477fdn** printer for the printing destination.
## Wifi
There are two Wifi networks:
1. BikecoachSecure
	- Password in BC Security  Card
2. BCFitnessCafe
   - Password: bcfitnesscafe

BikecoachSecure is meant for *staff only* and it is also the faster network. BCFitnessCafe, on the other hand, is a slower network that is meant for guests, customers, or clients.
