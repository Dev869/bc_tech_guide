# Equipment
## Stands & Tools
Each stand has an assigned color where they also have their own set of tools. It is important that you pay close attention to the color of the tool you are using... **always put the tools back in the correct place.**
## [Asset Tiger](https://www.myassettag.com/assettiger/)

*This is what we use to track equipment that is being lent out.*

### Checking Items In & out
When an asset, such as a bike or a wheel, is lent out to someone, check out that asset to ensure that we know who it's with. 

Do the following to check out an asset:
1. Under *Assets*, go to *Check out*.
2. Select *Select Assets*
3. Search and add the asset(s) you want to check out by  the tag number or name.
4. Click the box next to *Person* to select who you want to check out the asset(s) to. **If the person is not in the system already, you can add them by selecting the new option next to the *select person* box.**
5. Click *Check Out* to finish.


## Wheels Placement
At the moment we have too many wheels to be picky about where they go. Guess this is a free for all.
## Bikes Placement
At the moment we have too many bikes to be picky about where they go. Guess this is a free for all.
## Work Tag System
Whenever someone comes in with something that needs to be worked on (such as a bike that needs adjustment, a crank replacement, etc.) we **write up a work tag.** If you're not sure what the work tags look like, there's a *work tag board* just to the right of the double doors that go to the back storage room behind the mechanics area.


Fill out the tag to the best of your ability. It's alright if you're not sure what to do as long as you do the following:
1. Write down the **name and phone number** of whoever owns the equipment that needs to be worked on.
2. Write down the issue that the equipment is having.
